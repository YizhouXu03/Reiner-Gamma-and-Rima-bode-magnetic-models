# Reiner-Gamma-and-Rima-bode-magnetic-models
This study employs low-altitude magnetic data from the Lunar Prospector and Kaguya missions, utilizing an Equivalent Source Dipole (ESD) regional modeling method coupled with L2-regularization, to construct high-resolution crustal magnetic field models for two key lunar regions: Reiner Gamma and Rima Bode.
