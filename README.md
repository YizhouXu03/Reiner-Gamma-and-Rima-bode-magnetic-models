# Reiner-Gamma-and-Rima-bode-magnetic-models
This study employs low-altitude magnetic data from the Lunar Prospector and Kaguya missions, utilizing an Equivalent Source Dipole (ESD) regional modeling method coupled with L2-regularization, to construct high-resolution crustal magnetic field models for two key lunar regions: Reiner Gamma and Rima Bode. 
The data file contains the magnetic fields on the surface of the Reiner Gamma and Rima Bode regions obtained from this model. 
The model code folder contains the corresponding code for this model. 
The figure code folder contains the code for ploting figures.
